Dorothea Lange was a renowned American documentary photographer known for her powerful images of the Great Depression and World War II. Her photographs often humanized the struggles of those affected by these events, making them iconic symbols of hardship and resilience.

## Early Life and Background

Born on May 26, 1895, in Hoboken, New Jersey, Dorothea was the second child to Johann Berthold Wahlberg Lange and Nina (née Heess) Lange. The family moved frequently during her childhood due to her father's work as a engineer. In 1912, they settled in San Francisco, where Dorothea developed an interest in photography. She studied at Mills College in Oakland but did not graduate.

In the early 1920s, Dorothea began working as a portrait photographer in San Francisco, eventually opening her own studio with her husband, painter Maynard Dixon. Their marriage produced three sons, and they adopted one more child. However, their relationship became strained due to Dixon's infidelity, leading to a divorce.

## Photography Career

Dorothea began taking photographs of the working class during the Great Depression, focusing on those affected by economic hardship. Her work drew attention from the Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA), which employed her as a photographer for their programs in 1935. This role led to some of her most iconic works, including "Migrant Mother" and "White Angel Breadline."

"Migrant Mother," taken in February 1936, is perhaps Dorothea's most famous photograph. It depicts a destitute mother, Florence Owens Thompson, with her children on the side of a highway. This image became an instant symbol of the Great Depression's human cost, used by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to promote New Deal programs.

## Key Achievements and Legacy

Dorothea's work not only captured the struggles of those affected but also drew attention to social issues, such as poverty, racism, and displacement. Her photographs often highlighted the resilience and dignity of her subjects. As a result, she became an important advocate for human rights and social justice.

During World War II, Dorothea worked for the U.S. Department of War, photographing internment camps in the United States and documenting the experiences of Japanese Americans who were forcibly relocated. Her work during this period helped raise awareness about these issues.

## Context and Impact

Dorothea's photographs had a profound impact on public perception and policy. They influenced politicians, artists, and activists alike, contributing to changes in social welfare programs, immigration policies, and human rights laws.

Her legacy extends beyond her photography; Dorothea's work inspired generations of photographers and documentarians. Her commitment to capturing the stories of those often overlooked or marginalized has made her a trailblazer for photojournalism.

## Closing Summary

Dorothea Lange was an exceptional documentary photographer whose work continues to captivate audiences with its poignant portrayal of human struggles during pivotal moments in American history. Through her lens, we see not only the hardships but also the resilience and dignity of those affected by economic hardship, war, and social injustice. As a testament to the power of photography as a tool for advocacy and storytelling, Dorothea Lange's legacy remains an enduring reminder of the importance of human rights and social justice.
