Frida Kahlo is one of the most iconic and influential artists of the 20th century. Her life's work has captivated audiences worldwide, not only for its emotional depth and technical skill but also for its unapologetic representation of her experiences as a Mexican woman.

## Background / Early Life
Born on July 6, 1907, in Coyoacán, Mexico City, Frida Kahlo was the third daughter of Matilde Calderón y González and Guillermo Kahlo. Her father, a Hungarian-Jewish photographer, had immigrated to Mexico from Budapest, while her mother was a devout Catholic of Spanish and Indigenous descent. Growing up, Frida's artistic talent was encouraged by her parents; however, it was an accident at the age of 18 that would forever change her life. While traveling with her sister Cristina on a bus, Frida suffered a devastating spinal injury when the vehicle collided with a streetcar.

## Key Achievements / Reasons She is Known
Kahlo's near-fatal accident left her with chronic pain and required multiple surgeries throughout her life. During her recovery, she began painting as a way to cope with her physical and emotional suffering. Her artwork became an extension of her own experiences, emotions, and reflections on Mexican culture, identity, and the human condition. Some of her most notable works include "The Broken Column" (1944), "The Two Fridas" (1939), and "Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird" (1940). These pieces not only showcased her technical skill but also revealed a deep understanding of psychology, symbolism, and the human experience.

Kahlo's artwork often drew from Mexican folk art traditions, as well as European surrealism. This fusion allowed her to create a unique visual language that continues to inspire artists today. Her paintings frequently featured herself as the central figure, offering an intimate glimpse into her inner world. Through her work, Kahlo also explored themes of identity, culture, and the role of women in society.

## Relevant Context / Impact
During the 1920s and 1930s, Mexico was experiencing a cultural renaissance under the presidency of Lázaro Cárdenas, who actively promoted Mexican art, literature, and identity. This movement provided an ideal context for Kahlo's work to flourish. Her paintings not only reflected but also influenced the development of Mexican modernism.

Kahlo's impact extends far beyond her artistic contributions. She became a symbol of Mexican culture and a source of national pride. Her artwork has been celebrated globally, with many museums, galleries, and institutions showcasing her pieces. The Blue House (La Casa Azul), where Kahlo lived and worked in Coyoacán, is now a museum dedicated to her life and art.

## Closing Summary
Frida Kahlo's remarkable life and artistic legacy continue to captivate audiences worldwide. Her paintings, marked by technical skill and emotional depth, offer an unflinching portrayal of her experiences as a woman, artist, and Mexican national. Through her work, Kahlo has not only left an indelible mark on the art world but also inspired countless individuals with her unwavering determination to create despite adversity.
