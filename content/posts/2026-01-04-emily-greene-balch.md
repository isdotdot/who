Emily Greene Balch was a prominent American peace activist, writer, and academic who played a pivotal role in the development of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF). Her contributions to international relations, diplomacy, and social justice have left a lasting impact on the world.

**Early Life**

Born on October 8, 1868, in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, Balch was raised in a family that valued education and social reform. She grew up with six siblings, and her parents encouraged her to pursue higher education, which was uncommon for women at the time. Balch attended Wellesley College, where she earned her undergraduate degree in 1896. She then went on to study at the University of Chicago, where she received a Ph.D. in sociology in 1900.

**Key Achievements**

Balch's work as a peace activist began during World War I, when she became involved with the American Association for International Conciliation (AAIC). In 1915, she co-founded the AAIC's chapter in Boston and worked tirelessly to promote peace initiatives. After the war, Balch traveled extensively throughout Europe, attending conferences and meetings to advocate for international cooperation and disarmament.

In 1919, Balch joined the newly formed WILPF, serving as its executive secretary from 1920 to 1922. During her tenure, she worked closely with other prominent women's rights activists, including Jane Addams and Rosika Schwimmer. Together, they pushed for greater recognition of women's roles in international diplomacy and helped establish the organization as a leading voice for peace.

One of Balch's most notable contributions was her advocacy for the League of Nations. She traveled to Geneva, Switzerland, to participate in the 1920 International Conference on Social Work, where she presented a paper outlining the importance of women's participation in international affairs. Her efforts helped lay the groundwork for the establishment of the United Nations after World War II.

**Relevance and Impact**

Emily Greene Balch's work continues to resonate today due to her pioneering efforts in several areas:

* **Peace activism**: Balch was one of the first Americans to actively campaign against war, making her a trailblazer in the peace movement.
* **Women's rights**: Through her involvement with WILPF and other organizations, she helped pave the way for women's participation in international diplomacy and decision-making processes.
* **International cooperation**: Her advocacy for the League of Nations and later the United Nations helped establish these institutions as essential tools for maintaining global peace and security.

In recognition of her contributions to peace and social justice, Balch received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1946, along with John R. Mott. She continued to work tirelessly until her death on January 9, 1961, leaving behind a legacy that inspires new generations of activists and diplomats.
