Mary Fields was a trailblazing African American woman who broke multiple barriers in the late 19th century as a postal worker, entrepreneur, and philanthropist. Born into slavery in Tennessee around 1832, Fields' life story is a testament to her resilience and determination.

## Early Life

As a slave, Mary's early life was marked by hardship and trauma. However, after emancipation following the Civil War, she began building a new life for herself. She moved to Montana Territory, where she worked as a cook on a steamboat and later became one of the first African American women to work for the United States Postal Service.

Fields' entry into the postal service was no easy feat. In 1884, she applied for a job as a mail carrier in Missoula, Montana, but faced intense racism and sexism from local residents. Undeterred, Fields persevered, relying on her physical strength and determination to secure the position.

## Key Achievements

Fields' most notable achievement was becoming one of the first African American women to work for the United States Postal Service. As a mail carrier, she traversed treacherous terrain in Montana's wilderness, earning the respect of local residents with her bravery and reliability.

In addition to her postal career, Fields also established herself as an entrepreneur and philanthropist. She started her own business, a freight service that carried goods between Missoula and Saint Regis, Montana. This venture not only provided employment for local residents but also helped to establish the region's economy.

Fields was also known for her generosity, often using her resources to help those in need within her community. Her kindness earned her the nickname "Stagecoach Mary," a testament to her reputation as a tough yet compassionate individual.

## Context and Impact

During Fields' time as a postal worker and entrepreneur, Montana Territory was undergoing rapid growth and development. The construction of the Northern Pacific Railway had brought an influx of settlers, and the region's economy was booming. However, many residents faced significant challenges in accessing basic services, including mail delivery.

Fields' determination to secure a position with the Postal Service helped pave the way for future generations of women, particularly those from marginalized communities. Her entrepreneurial spirit also inspired others to start their own businesses, contributing to the growth and diversification of Montana's economy.

## Conclusion

Mary Fields' remarkable life is a testament to her strength, resilience, and determination in the face of adversity. As one of the first African American women to work for the United States Postal Service, Fields broke barriers and inspired others to follow in her footsteps. Her legacy as an entrepreneur, philanthropist, and trailblazer continues to inspire generations today.
