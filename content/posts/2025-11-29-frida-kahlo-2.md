Frida Kahlo is a renowned Mexican artist known for her self-portraits that blend elements of realism, symbolism, and fantasy. Her artwork often reflects her physical and emotional experiences, making her one of the most recognizable and celebrated artists of the 20th century.

### Early Life and Background

Born on July 6, 1907, in Coyoacán, Mexico City, Frida Kahlo was the third child of Guillermo and Matilde Calderón y González. Her father was a photographer and her mother was a devout Catholic. Kahlo's early life was marked by a devastating bus accident at age 18, which left her with multiple injuries, including a broken spine and pelvis.

The accident led to numerous surgeries and physical therapy sessions, during which she began to develop her artistic skills as a way to cope with the pain and emotional trauma. She would often paint while lying in bed or using specialized equipment that allowed her to hold brushes in her hands.

### Key Achievements

Kahlo's artwork quickly gained recognition, both in Mexico and internationally. Her first solo exhibition was held in 1938 at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York City, where she met artists like Diego Rivera, with whom she would later have a tumultuous relationship that lasted over two decades. The two married in 1929 but divorced in 1939 due to infidelity.

Throughout her life, Kahlo continued to produce artwork despite her physical limitations. Her paintings often depicted herself, but also explored themes of identity, culture, and the human experience. Some notable works include:

* "The Broken Column" (1944), a self-portrait that showcases her physical scars
* "Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird" (1940), a representation of her own mortality
* "What the Water Gave Me" (1938), an auto-biographical painting that explores her experiences as a woman

Kahlo's artwork has had a lasting impact on modern art. Her unique style, which blended realism with symbolism and fantasy, paved the way for future generations of artists to experiment with new techniques and themes.

### Context and Impact

In addition to her artistic contributions, Kahlo was also an advocate for Mexican culture and identity. She often incorporated folk art elements into her work, celebrating the rich heritage of her homeland. Her artwork has been interpreted as a reflection of the struggles faced by women in Mexico during the 20th century.

Kahlo's personal life was marked by turmoil and heartbreak, including multiple miscarriages and the loss of her leg due to gangrene. Despite these challenges, she continued to create artwork that captured the essence of her being.

### Summary
