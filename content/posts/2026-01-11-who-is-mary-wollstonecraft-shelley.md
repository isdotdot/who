Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley was a British novelist, essayist, and one of the first English writers to gain recognition as a science fiction author. She is best known for her novel "Frankenstein" (1818), which has become a classic of Gothic literature and a pioneering work in the science fiction genre.

## Early Life

Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley was born on August 30, 1797, in London, England. Her father, William Godwin, was a prominent philosopher and writer, while her mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, was a pioneering feminist and writer who died soon after giving birth to Mary. As the daughter of two influential writers, Mary was exposed to literary and philosophical ideas from an early age.

Mary's family moved to Wales when she was three years old, where her father continued to write and teach. However, the family's financial situation was precarious, and they eventually returned to London. In 1812, at the age of 15, Mary began a romantic relationship with Percy Bysshe Shelley, who would later become her husband.
