Margaret Atwood is a celebrated Canadian novelist, poet, literary critic, essayist, inventor of the LongPen technology, politician, and activist. She is one of Canada's most renowned authors, known for her diverse range of works that explore themes of feminism, politics, history, and human nature.

## Early Life

Born on November 18, 1939, in Ottawa, Ontario, Atwood grew up in a family of modest means. Her father, Carl Edmund Atwood, was an entomologist who worked as the chief of the Department of Entomology at the National Museum of Canada, while her mother, Dorothy Kathleen (Hurtubise) Atwood, was a nurse. The family moved frequently during Atwood's childhood due to her father's work assignments, which exposed her to various cultures and environments.

Atwood developed an interest in writing early on, encouraged by her parents' love for literature and the arts. She wrote her first stories as a child and continued to hone her skills throughout her teenage years. After completing high school at Le Collège du Sacré-Cœur (now Notre Dame Catholic High School), she attended Victoria College at the University of Toronto.

## Key Achievements
